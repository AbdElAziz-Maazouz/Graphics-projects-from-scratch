![Graphics Projects from Scratch](Project.jpg)
This repository contains a collection of graphics projects implemented from scratch in C++. It includes both 2D and 3D graphics projects, demonstrating various algorithms and techniques for drawing shapes, handling animations, and rendering 3D objects.

## 2D Graphics Project

This project is a simple graphics application that demonstrates various algorithms for drawing 2D shapes and animations using C++. It includes implementations of Bresenham's algorithm for lines and circles, polynomial and trigonometric methods for drawing circles and ellipses, and animations such as a clock and pendulum.
